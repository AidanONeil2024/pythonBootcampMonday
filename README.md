## Note

Python is an excellent choice for learning a coding language for two reasons. One, it is a great all-purpose language, used to automate tasks, clean data, run statistical and machine learning models, produce visualizations, write software, analyze text, scrape the web, etc., etc. Two, Python is known for having a shallow learning curve. You can do a lot with basic skills.

Will you really learn Python in a one-week bootcamp? Absolutely, if you can dedicate the week to learning. If you are feeling overwhelmed, remember you will have the materials to review even after the workshop ends. If you feel like the workshop is moving too slowly, great! 

This bootcamp focuses on giving you the confidence to know that you can use logic to solve any problem in Python. 


Tips to get the most out of this bootcamp:
-	Prioritize your learning. As best you can, try to minimize your other obligations for the week. Reschedule other meetings, let coworkers know that you’re going to be unavailable, etc.
-	Take actual breaks. Learning a new skill takes a lot of energy and brain power, so when you take a break from Python, walk away from your computer.
-	Get comfortable. The remote format hopefully means that you have more control over your learning environment than sitting in a classroom. Wear your softest slippers, drink coffee, buy your favorite snacks to munch on this week. 
-	Use Google. Professional Python coders use Google all day every day to look up the correct way to code. There’s no reason to store every function name in your memory. Instead, we’ll focus on how things fit together. 
-	If Python isn't your first coding language, try to go into it with an open mind. I often hear R coders, for example, say things like "That makes no sense!" or "They should have made it work a different way." That may be true or not, but it won't ever change how Python is written, and it could prevent you from making progress. 



## Daily Schedule

Before the lecture: 
<br>Download the day's materials from the GitHub repo - instructions are at the end of this document.

10:00 am – Noon Central	
<br>Zoom lecture/code along
<br>Cameras not required, so it’s ok to wear your pajamas. Make sure you have coffee and a snack. Maybe get some exercise before the lecture to approach the day with energy. Or sleep in, whatever you need. If you have questions during the lecture, please put them in the Zoom chat. Feel free to answer questions in the chat if you know the answer! I will politely correct you if you get it wrong.
<br>If you can't make the live lecture, watch the recording - posted around 1 pm Central each day.

Noon – 4 pm		
<br>Take a lunch break.
<br>Complete daily homework exercises
<br>Please note – there is new information that you need to learn in the Homework assignments. They are not just practice. Answer keys are also provided. 
<br>Take the daily quiz - test yourself and get some more practice. Answer key is provided.
<br>Post questions in the Discussion section of Canvas if you want to get opinions from your classmates.

If you are not following this schedule, you should complete all the homework and the daily quiz before the next day’s 10 am lecture or before you watch the next lecture recording. 

Feel free to email me your questions at any time of day or night – I will set aside time to answer email questions during the day and before the 10 am lectures.


## Weekly schedule

A more thorough schedule will be provided on the first day. 

In general, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday will cover the Python language. On Thursday, you will learn how to put your skills into practice by writing and running a Python script. On Friday, we will work with a dataset in the Pandas module, which lets you shape data into rows and columns within Python.


## Tasks to complete before the first day

We will be using the latest version of Python – currently 3.7, 3.8 or 3.9.

You can install Python on your computer or you can access it online. Either way is fine for this workshop.

To install Python on your computer, install a software bundle called Anaconda.

**If you have never installed Anaconda on your computer before:**

Go to this website: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
Click the “Download” button.
Choose the correct installation for your computer.
When installing Anaconda, you may be asked whether you want to install Visual Studio Code as well. This is up to you. We do not use it explicitly in the workshops.

Email me if you have issues installing Anaconda. 

If you get Anaconda installed, open the Anaconda Navigator. Open Jupyter Lab (it will open in your web browser, but it actually doesn’t need the internet). Launch a new Python 3 Notebook. If this works, you’re good to go.

If you cannot install Anaconda on your computer or if you have too many issues with the installation, don’t worry. You can access the materials and write code in the Python language online. You will be using Google Colab, and I will provide more instructions on Monday.

**If you already have Python 2 installed with Anaconda:**

You can either try to get Python 3 working with Jupyter on your computer following these steps: https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/resources/adding-python-3-to-jupyter-notebook/

Or, you can access the materials and write code in the Python language online. You will be using Google Colab, and I will provide more instructions on Monday.


## How to open Jupyter Notebooks

Many of the lectures, homeworks, and quizzes will be in a Jupyter Notebook format. You have two options for opening the notebooks.
This example uses the Monday lecture:

If you are running Jupyter Lab on your own computer:
- Go to https://github.com/aGitHasNoName/pythonBootcampMonday. Click on the green Code button and choose Download ZIP.  Unzip that folder. Open Anaconda Navigator and open Jupyter Lab. Navigate to the folder you just unzipped. Open mondayLecture.ipynb

If you are using Google Colab (online):
- Go to colab.research.google.com. Choose GitHub on the orange menu. Search for agithasnoname/pythonbootcampmonday. Choose mondayLecture.ipynb
